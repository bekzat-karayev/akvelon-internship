## Algorithms Task 1 - Single Number

### Task description

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Example 1**
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3**
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```
